### SPACEMAN GAME :rocket: :astronaut:
---

The game Spaceman is similar to Hangman, focusing on word guessing and limited attempts.

In this game, the player will be provided with a "secret word" and a hint. The player must guess the letters in the word. There will only be 6 attempts and if the player reached the maximum tries, the player loses the game.
